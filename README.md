This repository is public and contains some PowerCLI functions to help administrators manage their vSphere environments.

I have a private repository named `vMe-In-A-Shell` that contains an entensive structured set of CRUD operations for vSphere and other VMware components as well as configuration and common parameters files. vMe In A Shell 
also caputes daily settings snapshots and retains the report in HTML. vMe In A Shell additionaly helps parse log files looking for specific strings that relate to known 
issues in the vSphere environment.

`vMe-In-A-Shell` stands for `virtualMe In A Shell`.

vMe In A Shell is a menu based assistant styled program that is released on a payment base. vMe In A Shell can be released(bought) in partiality for targeting only specific VMware components. vMe In A Shell is meant to provide VMware expertise and/or an "extra VMware administrator" to organizations that run and manage VMware environment(s).
The purchase of vMe In A Shell will be bound to a contract with and SLA and confidentiality agreement. The purchase includes detailed instructions for installing and configuring the toolset as well as 20 hours of call support per year plus the ability to pull new repository content throughout the course of one year from the purchase date. vMe In A Shell also comes with a configuration script to help administrators set up vMe In A Shell to be used in their environment.
